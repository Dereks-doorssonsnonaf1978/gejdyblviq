Just walked out of Thudarum and wow, think I forgot how to walk straight â€” mind still in tatters like popcorn scraps sticking to my shoes. The theater was like a beehive, buzzing everywhere, couldn't even hear my thoughts sometimes. Okay so, the movieâ€¦ right, where do I even start?

Scenes flipping in my brain like cards. That moment with the train - oh, what was with all those birds flying in the opposite direction? Kinda like when youâ€™re trying to swim upstream with a crowd of Monday commuters. It was LOUD, like listening through a seashell kind of loud, and my back, ugh, feels like it molded into the shape of ancient upholstery. Can still feel the popcorn crunch on my jeans, pretty sure half the bag ended up on the floor, whoops. 

> That one flash into the past when theyâ€™re running through that endless field made me think of when Uncle Joe tried making us run in the woods after Thanksgiving dinner. Why the colors? Vibrant like a carnival ride. Did that make sense? Kinda like when your brain decides to mix memories with a dream, all in HD.

Forgot how much I love a twist! When they revealed the thing with the clock - didnâ€™t see that coming, or maybe I did but who really knows anything? Itâ€™s like when you download the movie youâ€™ve already seen just in case you pick up on something new...is that something we do? Anyway, download the movie and watch it twice, I guess. Haha.

> The smell in there was a mix of nostalgia and spilled soda. Why are theaters so sticky, and why do I always forget that before coming in? Felt like my arm got glued to the seat, like I was an experimental audience specimen forever captive.

Remember that floating scene? Kind of like being half-awake on a Tuesday morning or when you scare yourself awake thinking youâ€™re late but youâ€™re not. It floated off the screen or maybe I just floated for a second. Wanna say other things but words feel slippery.

Err, was I supposed to say something specific? Someone once asked, maybe? Oh right... Just need to watch the movie because who knows if my memory is even real right now. Everythingâ€™s a swirling, mismatched jigsaw.

If (life == theaterExperience) { memory--; } else { maybeWriteMoreC++; } // huh? ðŸ¤”
